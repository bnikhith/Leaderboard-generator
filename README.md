# Leaderboard-generator
A python script which takes the responses of google forms MCQs and generate the leaderboard according to the score by the desired details.This is done for the client CVR CSI Student Branch (2016-17).

lol.. That was a student branch at our college. This is a pretty straight and simple script to work with excel sheets and validate the test score by mapping user responses and key sheet. package "xlrd"(https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/) used to work with excel sheets. It makes our job very very easy to understand and work with excel sheets allowing us to focus on core problem to solve.

I have placed this repo here to share this moment. Where, in initial days of python programming, how this script made me a day saviour.
I was volunteering for a quiz conducted, where responses are collected by google forms. Do to some technical reasons quiz got delayed and ended up at around 3:00PM, where students were supposed to catch the buses by 3:45PM after evaluation and prize distribution. Everyone gave up as it would be impossible to manually evaluate the responses in excel sheet. Luckily in very recent times then, I was working around with excel sheets using python. So i stood up and promised they will get the results by 3:30 and yayyy got this.. (very lame version of it).

No matter how simple it is or already it is made ready for use by someone else. For an average under graduate like me, applying it in real time scenario gives an immense zeal to work further on stuff like that and some "favouritism" :P .
